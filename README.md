-Please download the database, unzipped it, create a new folder called db and put the extracted database inside that folder if youd like to use this database.

## Introduction

As part of our Web Development course at the University of St. Thomas, this project aimed at constructing a dynamic server focused on a specific sustainability topic. Two other students and I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Node.js to create this dynamic webserver. We chose to focus on airplanes and flights as our sustainability topic. In addition to actually creating the web server, we also needed to come up with how to efficiently retrieve and display the desired data from the database. To do this, we had to learn not only about the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript parts of the program, but also about how database management works and some of the issues that can be caused from poorly accessing and manipulating data. 

## Impact

This project not only helped us improve our programming skills and expand our knowledge on servers and database management, but also touched on sustainability and how impactful the amount of flights there are each day around the world are on the environment. This project was a very rewarding challenge. Not only did we improve as individual programmers, but we also learned a lot of useful things about working as a group and using GIT in addition to a deeper understanding of sustainability. 

Overall this project, although not very visually appealing, was one of my favorites to work on because of the new challenges of working with a database, working in a team, and being able to view the really interesting data after we finished building the web server.
